🧠 What You Cover – From Head to Toe & Then Some
	1.	🧠 Neuro – LOC, PERRLA, motor moves, sensation checks. If their brain ain’t right, nothing’s right.
	2.	👁️ HEENT – From scalp to throat. Infections love to hide here, so dig in.
	3.	🫁 Respiratory – Chest rise, lung sounds, accessory muscles—if they can’t breathe, you ain’t got time to be cute.
	4.	❤️ Cardiac – Heart rate, BP, sounds, pulses. Don’t let a murmur sneak past you.
	5.	🍎 GI – Listen before you poke. Document those BMs like a stool detective.
	6.	🚰 GU – Input/output, bladder checks, edema watch. You better clock that pee.
	7.	🦴 MSK – ROM, strength, balance. Fall risks don’t announce themselves.
	8.	🌡️ Skin Check – Turgor, temp, breakdown zones. Pressure injuries don’t care if you “forgot.”
	9.	📝 Safety & Docs – ID bands, hygiene, reporting—it’s the basics that get folks sued.
